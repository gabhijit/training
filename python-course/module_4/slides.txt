Slide 1
-------

 * Motivating Example - Birthday Paradox


Slide 1 Notes
-------------

Through this example what we are going to see how numpy makes numerical computations very fast and is the basis of pandas and then we will explore pandas. Start with a simple matplotlib example as well.


Slide 2
--------
Pandas Basic Data Structures

 * Series
 * DataFrame

Slide 2 Notes:
--------------

Series is like a one dimensional array with index

Data Frame is 2 dimensional Array with Index

Best is to try some hands on with data -

Let's play with some random data - we'd understand the following concepts

Indexing

Selection

Two very basic concepts in Pandas. Let's look at them

Indexing: Any series -
1. pd.date_range('20110101', periods=10, frequency='W') # Note: Starting with Sunday
2. Any array : Even something like [None, 1, 3, 0, 2] or [None, 1, 3, 1, 2]


Selection: Main thing to remember about Selection is following options

.iloc : Integer position based starting from zero
.loc : Lookup index
[] : Usual [] should be mainly used for slicing, use loc, iloc whenever applicable
[condition] : Boolean Condition


Merging and Grouping
--------------------

We are going to use movielens data. This part of the tutorial is inspired by

http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/using-pandas-on-the-movielens-dataset/

We are going to try to answer the following questions - using techniques from Pandas

1. What is the distribution of users ages in the dataset? (simple histogram)
2. What is mean, median, mode, min and max age for the data in the group?
3. What is the distribution of users ages for females?
4. Which movie is most famous amongst 'men' and 'women'?
5. Which movie has got maximum number of ratings or which movie is the most famous one?
6. Which movie has got the maximum number of 5 ratings?
7. Which are the top 10 movies with average rating and minimum ratings are 100?

We'll learn concepts as we try to find answers to the questions above.


Simple statistics about data, Merging, Grouping
